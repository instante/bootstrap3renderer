## Version 2.0 alpha is out!
Lots of internals changed in Nette 2.4. Instante Bootstrap renderer
 version 2.0 was completely re-written to get rid of much legacy code,
 bringing up new, cleaner API and new features in advanced custom rendering.
 Also, version 2.0 replaces several "magics" by cleaner OOP solution.

Testing this alpha and submitting any issues and/or pull requests to help
 improve it is welcomed.
 
**If you need Nette <= 2.3 compatibility or have no time to adopt to new API,
use Bootstrap 3 Renderer version 1.\***
